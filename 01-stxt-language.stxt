	Content:
		It is a purely semantic language, with very basic rules,
		that allows the creation of documents with structured content
		that is easy to interpret, both by humans and machines.
		You could be reading a document in STxT without even realizing
		that it is.
		
		STxT: A language for the web. It doesnâ€™t mean just another one among many.
		It means _A_ language for the web. Just one. And at the same time, many.
		All those you want. This is the proposal.
		
		STxT is a language for writing structured documents. It allows creating
		documents unambiguously, adhering to very precise rules,
		but producing documents that can be read by people
		without technical knowledge.
						 
		In fact, the documents have meaning in themselves,
		without any additional translation being necessary.
		They have a hierarchical structure very similar to XML documents,
		and their translation can be direct.
