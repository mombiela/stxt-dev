																					<h1><a id="index_0"></a>Chapter 8: <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> and Other Technologies</h1>
							<p>There are thousands of examples that can be made with this technology.
It is as simple as taking any example from another language
and seeing how it would be written in <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>. Perhaps the simplest is an example
derived from XML, as it has many parallels with <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>.</p>
<p>Many examples I have obtained from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>An (invented) example of XML would be:</p>

						<pre>
&lt;Library&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;29 July 1954&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;ISBN&gt;76542&lt;/ISBN&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;11 November 1954&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;ISBN&gt;12345&lt;/ISBN&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;20 October 1955&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
&lt;/Library&gt;</pre>
						<p>The same in <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>:</p>

						<pre>Library (www.examples.com/demo.stxt):
    Book:
        id: 1
        Title: The Fellowship of the Ring
        Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
        Language: EN
        Published: 29 July 1954

        Genre: High fantasy Adventure</pre>
						<p>Another example in XML:</p>

						<pre>&lt;email&gt;
&lt;from&gt;John Smith&lt;/from&gt;
&lt;to&gt;Mery Adams&lt;/to&gt; 
&lt;cc&gt;Keyla Brown&lt;cc&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Project report&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;body&gt;Hello Mery!! The book is finished!!&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/email&gt;</pre>
						<p>In <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>, it is transformed into:</p>

						<pre>Email (www.example.com/email.stxt):
    From: John Smith
    To: Mery Adams
    Cc: Keyla Brown
    Title: Project report
    Body: Hello Mery!! The book is finished!!</pre>
						<p>We can see that the conversion between the two formats is instant, though <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> is much more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>By the way, there is a hidden chapter, <a href="08-stxt-xml">STXT and XML</a>, in case you want to read it.
I wrote it in 2013, and it's... interesting. Read at your own risk ;-)</p>

						<h2><a id="index_1"></a>Wikipedia (*)</h2>
							<p>I have great admiration for Wikipedia. I think it is one of the best projects created on the Internet.</p>
<p><em>How could it benefit from <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>?</em></p>
<p>Well, Wikipedia could have different templates:
actors, politicians, TV series, movies, cities, countries, rivers... sharing grammars in many cases.
For example, both actors and politicians can have biographies, but actors would also have a list of movies.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would be very interesting to mix <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> with Wikipedia's own language.
I think this is a point where <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> excels compared to most languages.
The blend with so-called &quot;lightweight markup languages&quot; is truly spectacular.</p>
<p>So, you can create mixed texts like this:</p>

						<pre>City (www.wikipedia.org/city.stxt):
    Name: Barcelona 
    Autonomous Community: Catalonia
    Country: Spain
    
    History:
        {{Main|History of Barcelona}}
        The founding of Barcelona is the subject of 
        two different legends. The first attributes 
        the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]].
        The second legend attributes the foundation
        of the city directly to the historical
        [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Hamilcar Barca]],
        father of [[Hannibal]], who named the city ''Barcino''
        after his family in the 3rd century BC.
        ...</pre>
						<p>Another advantage is that with <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> we would not only have &quot;templates&quot; of
what city information should look like, but we could also
apply styles and formats depending on the type of document.</p>

						<h2><a id="index_2"></a><span class='STxT'>STxT</span> and Other Technologies</h2>
							<h3><a id="index_3"></a>Lightweight Markup Language</h3>
							<p>Lightweight markup languages have seen a spectacular rise thanks to projects like Wikipedia.
Thanks to them, text can be defined much more simply than having to write tags like HTML.
But they have a major drawback: They do not have a clear structure or semantics.</p>
<p>In fact, practically all of them focus on text styling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bold</li>
<li>Italics</li>
<li>Lists of items</li>
<li>Data tables</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>It is surprising to see what we can achieve by combining these languages with <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>.
We get text that is easy to interpret, with defined semantics, and the expressiveness of both languages.</p>
<p>An example:</p>

						<pre>Product:
    Name: Magic memory
    Price: 10&euro;
    Description:
        This product produces a _magical rejuvenation_
        of memory and provides an **immediate** effect
        on all those who try it.
        
        Effects:
        
        * Rapid memorization
        * Automatic learning
        * Increased concentration</pre>
						<p>We see that we have given structure thanks to <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>, but the description is given
in Wikipedia style.</p>

						<div class="row">
		<div class="assert"><p>The combination of <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> with <em>Lightweight markup languages</em> is simply spectacular</p>
</div>
	</div>
						<h3><a id="index_4"></a>TeX, LaTeX</h3>
							<p>Apologies if I criticize too much. I never do it without offering an alternative or a reason. I like constructive criticism ;-)
I have seen that one of TeX's goals is for a document to print the same now and 100 years from now.
I thought that was perfect... until today. Now I think the goal should be
for it to mean the same thing now and 100 years from now, and for it to be <em>understood</em> now and 100 years from now.
And by as many people as possible. This is not achieved with TeX, but it is with <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>.
A document is understood today and 100 years from now. How do I think it should evolve?
I would create documents in <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>, specify a grammar for the different types of documents,
allow TeX elements (like formulas) in the same way that lightweight markup languages do,
and use TeX as the rendering engine.</p>
<p>I dare say that TeX is unbeatable in terms of rendering; and I think it will remain so for at least 100 more years ;-)</p>
<p>What would a document look like? Well, a simple example would be something like this:</p>

						<p>In fact, now that we can think about <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>, it might be time to create formulas in another way,
or a more simplified notation, such as:</p>

Paragraph:
    Hello World!!</pre>
						<p>Well, there are thousands of possibilities and ways to approach the problem; I'll leave it to you as an exercise ;-D</p>

						<div class="row">
		<div class="assert"><p>What have we gained compared to just TeX?</p>
</div>
	</div>
						<ul>
<li>Ease of document creation</li>
<li>UTF-8</li>
<li>Defined structure</li>
<li>Semantic text</li>
<li>Readable text</li>
</ul>
<p>And also, we have maintained the compactness in the creation of mathematical formulas
and other elements where TeX is indeed a great language.</p>

						<h3><a id="index_5"></a>JSON</h3>
							<p>JSON initially has nothing to do with <span class='STxT'>STxT</span>, but there are certain times
when they might compete. I am thinking of configuration files, for example.
Furthermore, it is more flexible and easier to read when embedding large amounts of text,
something that always needs to be considered with JSON due to escaping characters.</p>
<p>But there is no need to worry too much.
I do not think JSON and <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> are direct competitors,
due to their different areas of application.</p>

						<h3><a id="index_6"></a>YAML</h3>
							<p>Perhaps YAML is the one that most resembles <span class='STxT'>STxT</span> in approach, although it is also very different.
We believe that with our structure, we can show the same as YAML,
and much more simply. Additionally, we can add semantics to the document with namespaces,
while still allowing text that is readable to most people,
regardless of their technical knowledge.</p>
