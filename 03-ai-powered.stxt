		With the arrival of generative AI, one thing that has surprised me is how naturally it handles STxT.
		It seems as if it knows it, with just a brief introduction. I’m going to share a conversation, and you can judge for yourself.

	Code: 
		Hello, I'm going to talk to you about the STXT (SemanticText) language.
		It’s a language for writing structured documents. The documents have tags 
		separated by the ":" character, and they are nested using tabs.
		With the same language, you can define a namespace that will define 
		a document type and the allowed and disallowed tags.
		
		Here’s an example of a namespace:
		
		Namespace: www.kocinando.com/receta.stxt
			Recipe:
			    Description: (?) TEXT
			    Servings: (?) NUMBER
				Difficulty: (?) ENUM
				   	: easy
				   	: medium
			    	: hard
			    Ingredients: (1)
					Ingredient: (+)
			    Steps: (1)
			    	Step: (+)
			    	
		Here’s an example of a document from that namespace:
		
		Recipe (www.kocinando.com/receta.stxt): Macaroni Recipe
			Description:
				This is the description of...
				This is the description of...
			Servings: 3
			Difficulty: easy
			Ingredients:
				Ingredient: (100g) Tomato
				Ingredient: (240g) Macaroni
			Steps:
				Step: (1) Make the sauce
				Step: (2) Brown the meat

		Did you understand what I explained to you?
		
	Subheader: AI
	
	Content: 
	
		Yes, I understood what you explained to me about the STXT (SemanticText) language.
		It’s a language for structuring documents using tags that are 
		organized hierarchically through tabulations. Additionally, the tags are 
		defined within a namespace, which establishes the allowed tags 
		and their possible values or formats.

		In your example, you defined a specific namespace for cooking recipes 
		(www.kocinando.com/receta.stxt) that includes tags like Recipe, 
		Description, Servings, Difficulty, Ingredients, Ingredient, Steps, and Step. 
		Each tag can have certain associated value types, such as free text (TEXT), 
		numbers (NUMBER), or enumerated values (ENUM) with specific options like easy, medium, and hard.

		Then, you showed how a recipe document can be structured using 
		this namespace, following the hierarchy and rules defined within it.
		For example, in the macaroni recipe document, the description, 
		the number of servings, the difficulty, the ingredients with their respective quantities, 
		and the steps to follow are all specified, adhering to the structure defined in the namespace.

		Is there anything more specific you would like to discuss or clarify about this language?

	Content: 
		1. Well, first of all: now it’s real. **Maybe this recipe is better than mine :-D**
		2. Secondly: how easily the AI handled the documents :-O
		3. Finally, note that when displaying the result, it was identified as **YAML** instead of STXT. I understand they are very similar; we will discuss 
		   the similarities and differences later on.
